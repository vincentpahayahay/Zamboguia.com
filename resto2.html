	<p>The Filipino Muslims, also known as the Moros, take pride in their distinct cuisine. Although sharing some similarities with other parts of the country in terms of seasonings and ingredients like garlic, onions, and ginger, what make Moro cuisine different are other spices like turmeric, lemongrass, galangal, and kaffir lime â€” which are more commonly used by our ASEAN neighbors. It also utilizes burnt or blackened coconut meat in some dishes.</p>
	<p>Some of the Moro faves are beef randang, piaparan, bakas, chicken pyanggang, pater, dodol, and lukatis. If you want to sample several dishes in one sitting, the latal is your best choice. It is a platter of some native dishes of the region</p>
	<p>Both <b>Bay Tal Mal</b> (at SM Mindpro) and <b>Dennis Coffee Garden</b> (near the airport) have latal on their menu.</p>
