		<p>Opened to the public in the 1910s, the Pasonanca Park is another green space for nature lovers and those who want to have a quick escape from the much busier city center. It houses the Camp Limbaga (Scout Limbaga Campsite) with a convention center, an amphitheater, an aviary, a floral garden and butterfly sanctuary, and public swimming pools — a kiddie pool, a natural pool, and an Olympic-size pool.</p>
		<p>Probably the most famous attraction is the Pasonanca Treehouse. Constructed in 1960, it was originally built to serve as the Youth Citizenship Training Center. Today, visitors come here to take photos, but if you want to spend more time here, you can rent the treehouse too! Make sure to contact the LGU’s admin first to coordinate. You can buy food along the way from the sidestreet restaurants, stores, and BBQ stands.</p>
