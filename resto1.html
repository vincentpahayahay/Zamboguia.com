	<h1 style="color:orange">Curacha</h1>
	<p>Curacha means cockroach in the Chavacano language, but — before you lose your appetite — we’re not asking you to go full Fear Factor here. Instead, we’re inviting you to have a taste of the most mouth-watering crustaceans that Zamboanga has to offer — spanner crabs! (It got its name because of its spiky appearance.</p>
	<p>So what is it exactly? We are talking about Zamboanga’s gastronomic gem. Curacha looks like the love child of a huge crab and a hairy lobster. Known for its consistent red appearance, whether raw or cooked, it is sought after because it’s meatier than other crabs and packs more flavor. Thankfully, they thrive in the bosom of the Sulu Sea.</p>
	<p>Your trip won’t be complete without trying a dish or two. <b style="color:red">Alavar’s Seafood Restaurant</b> is famous for its curacha dish cooked in its equally popular specialty sauce.</p>
	<p>If you want to take some home, head over to <b style="color:red">Aderes Flea Market</b> in Guiwan, where you can purchase fresh fresh, uncooked curacha at a lower price. Lobsters are also available!</p>
