		<p>OK, first things first, despite the name, you need cash when shopping here so please put down whatever it is you plan to trade. The name is a nod to the trading system of exchanging goods that was widely practiced in this part of the world back in the day.</p>
		<p>Today, however, it functions just like any other shopping center. Time to brush up on your haggling skills when you dive into this shopping paradise, tempting you with its cheap imported offerings from the neighboring countries Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>
		<p>Alongside local products, a wide array of imported goods are sold here — souvenirs, food, clothes, fabrics, gadgets, accessories, among others. Get a hold of your favorite Malaysian or Indonesian chocolates, coffee brands (Old Town Cofee and others), and milk tea (teh tarik) at relatively cheaper prices. Lastly, don’t forget to pause and breathe. Good? Okay. Let the second wave of haggling and negotiating begin!</p>
