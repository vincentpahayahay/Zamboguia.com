		<p>Located in Barangay Sibulao, Merloquet Falls stands proud near the cityâ€™s boundary with Zamboanga Sibugay, approximately two hours away from downtown Zamboanga City. It is a two-tiered drop but its main attraction is the beautiful curtain waterfalls on its base, approximately 10-meter high and 15-meter wide stair-like wall to a shallow pool, definitely one-of-a-kind in the Philippines. The upper tier is a shorter drop and sloped diagonally, approximately 5-meter high and 10-meter wide.</p>
		<p>Merloquet Falls may fall short on grandeur compared with other waterfalls in Mindanao but its uniqueness is a charmer. Despite its exposure in the past years, this spot is still in its raw state, and less crowded and busy compared with other known waterfalls in the country.</p>
		<p>Sit on its natural steps and enjoy the natural back massage of its gushing cold waters or avail of the rappelling experience offered by Zamboanga based adventure companies to best enjoy Merloquet Falls.</p>
