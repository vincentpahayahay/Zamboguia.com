	<p>Of course! Any TPT trip isn’t complete without delving into the street food scene! These everyday accessible munchies tell a lot about the place, its people, and its culture. You can find street food anywhere, especially in busy areas like the public market and around the city hall</p>
	<p><b>Paseo del Mar</b> has its share of street grubs and snacks. <b>R.T. Lim Boulevard</b> also hosts a number of street food peddlers. Some of the streetfood choices are satay or “ihaw-ihaw”, pastil, sicalang, mi goreng and lokot-lokot.</p>
	<p>But perhaps the most iconic of all is satti, a breakfast favorite among locals. Satti is usually skewered beef or chicken, grilled and then served half-dipped in a bowl of spicy sauce with rice shaped into cubes. Best place to eat Satti is in <b>Jimmy's Satti Haus</b>.</p>
