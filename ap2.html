		<h1 style="color:orange">Fort Pilar, Zamboanga City</h1>
		<p>Also called <i>Fortaleza del Pilar</i>, Fort Pilar dates back to the 17th century, originally serving as a Spanish military defense post. Fast forward to the present, this bastioned fort is a major historical landmark of the city. Recognized as a National Cultural Treasure in 1973, the fort underwent restorations and is regularly maintained by the city.</p>
		<p>It cradles an open-air 18th-century Marian shrine — <b>Our Lady of the Pillar</b> — with an altar and stone seating for the devotees who want to pray and reflect. On Sundays, monoblock chairs dot the area for the regular mass</p>
		<p>The fort also houses a regional branch of the National Museum of the Philippines, the bells of the Sanctuary to the Lady of the Pillar, and a fountain. The fort is located near Paseo del Mar and Zamboanga State College of Marine Science and Technology.</p>
