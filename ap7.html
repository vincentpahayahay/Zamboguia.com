		<h1 style="color:#5A5A5A">Zamboanga City Hall</h1>
		<p>Smack at the very heart of the city center, where well-preserved colonial structures are clustered, the Zamboanga City Hall is considered one of the important heritage sites in the city.</p>
		<p>Recognized as a National Historical Site, it was originally used as the official residence of the US Military Governor of the then Moro Province. Later on, it became the government seat of the former Zamboanga Province. It has been serving as the administrative seat of Zamboanga City since 1937. Rizal Park or Plaza Rizal is just across the city hall</p>
