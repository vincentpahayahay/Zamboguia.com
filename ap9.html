		<h1 style="color:orange">Yakan Weaving Village</h1>
		<p>While in Zamboanga City, don’t pass up the opportunity to take home the best tangible souvenirs you can buy — products made from the exquisite Yakan fabric, which takes time to finish, depending on the intricacy of the designs and patterns. The Yakan are the traditional inhabitants of Basilan and other areas in this part of Mindanao.</p>
		<p>Here in Zamboanga City, you’ll find the Yakan Weaving Village, which harbors local shops selling traditional products and practical accessories including bags, purses, pencil cases, and even yards of Yakan fabrics. You can also watch (or try for yourself!) the traditional process of Yakan weaving.</p>
	
		<h3>How to get to Yakan Weaving Village?</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Major airlines have direct flights from Cebu, Davao City and Manila going to Asia's Latin City. By land (bus ride), from Cagayan de Oro City:more or less 15 hours; from Dipolog City:more or less 8 hours; and from Pagadian City:more or less 8 hours.</li>
			<li>Once you're in Zamboanga City, it is easy enough to get to Upper Calarian. All you have to do is go to Volderosa Street near the public market and snag a jeep headed for Upper Calarian. Look for one that passes Gate 2 (ask the driver), which passes right by the village. The trip takes about 45 minutes in heavy traffic, and you will see the La Vista del Mar resort right across from it. Finding the village itself is not easy, because there is not a lot of fanfare leading up to it from the public road, and only a small tarp marking the place. Make sure the driver remembers to drop you off or you’ll miss the path to it altogether.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Opening Hours:</h3>
