		<p>Just across Fort Pilar is Paseo del Mar, a waterfront recreational park facing the Basilan Strait. Aside from the souvenir shops, local food vendors, and eateries, the newly renovated park added a children’s playground and a skatepark, making it a favorite hang-out place for the locals.</p>
		<p>It caters not just to families, friends, and couples but also to those who want to spend their alone time or me-time. Several tables and chairs are arranged for those who like to go food tripping here. Local dishes, snacks, and street fare are available. Benches also line the boardwalk, where sunset revelers lounge to watch the sunlight paints the sky with a beautiful gradient of colors as the day turns into night.</p>
